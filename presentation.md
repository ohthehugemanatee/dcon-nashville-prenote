Stand by Your Code
===



Sometimes it’s hard to be a coder

Giving all your nights to open source.

You’ll have bad times

And laggy run times

Seeing things that you just can’t debug



If you love it, you’ll xdebug it,

Even though it’s hard to understand

And if you love it,

Oh be proud of it,

‘Cause after all it’s just some code



Stand by your code,

Keep checking on the bug queue

Make sure your README’s clear, too

When nights are cold and lonely



Stand by your code,

And show the world it’s open

Keep giving all the code you can



Stand by your code



Stand by your code

And show the world you love it

Keep giving all the code you can!

Stand by your code!

Geeks in Low Basements
===



Oh the site wouldn’t boot

Couldn’t log in as root

The database tables were bare

The last one to know

Site monitor’s slow

I was the first one

Who should have been there.



I was caught by surprise 

And had fear in my eyes

When my boss asked me to explain.

And I turned to you

Said, “Buddy, we may be through.”

But you just smiled and exclaimed ...



Well I got friends in low basements

Where cron runs backups

And all the devops and admins play

So we’ll be okay!



Now I’ve been to some nerdy places

But that server room is a geek oasis

Oh, I’ve got friends in low basements



(Cheer for the solo!)



Well something went wrong

The config was gone

But then, we’ve all been there before,

Now nothing looks right

Not even line height

And the front page just links to “Read more...”



Hey I didn’t mean

To cause a big scene

Just give me ten minutes and then

The site will be up

Without a hiccup

Just as it’s always been



Well I got friends in low basements

Where cron runs backups

And all the devops and admins play

So we’ll be okay!



Now I’ve been to some nerdy places

But that server room is a geek oasis

Oh, I’ve got friends in low basements



(Oh no, is he really interrupting the song? This is totally unplanned!)



Well something went wrong

The config was gone

But then, we’ve all been there before,

Now nothing looks right

Not even line height

And the front page just links to “Read more...”



Hey I didn’t mean to cause a big scene

Just wait ‘till I rewrite this class

‘Cuz sooner or later

I’ll be back in the code

And you can kiss my SaaS!

Freelance Dev
===



Work is a vital thing

So I can buy my cowboy bling

I code with wild desire

But no… body wants to hire



I’m a freelance dev who no one wants to hire,

Rates went down, down, down,

And my bills went higher.

Now I’m screwed, screwed, screwed

It’s getting dire

Got to get hired



I’m a freelance dev who no one wants to hire,

Rates went down, down, down

And my bills went higher

Now I’m screwed, screwed, screwed

It’s getting dire

Got to get hired



LinkedIn is really neat

To post your skills and feats

Spent all day on my profile

Then my Inmail went wild



I’m a freelance dev who no one wants to hire,

Rates went down, down, down

And my bills went higher

Now I’m screwed, screwed, screwed

It’s getting dire

Got to get hired



No longer screwed, screwed, screwed

I just got hired



He's not screwed, screwed, screwed

He just got hired

He just got hired

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

Please I’ve got a deadline coming ‘round



In cups of tea, you take good care

Of worn out people everywhere

First thing today, I ground my coffee beans



First cup was like a breath of spring

The next was good, it woke my brain

And I cannot work without you

Caffeine



You keep me from the arms of sleep

And there’s nothing I can do to keep

From crying when my cup is done

Caffeine



And work gets really hard to do

My being suffers without you

But you don’t know what you mean to me,

Caffeine



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

Please I’ve got a deadline coming ‘round



I could skip a day or ten

But I could never work again

Without the only drug for me

Caffeine



I have to have some more of you

My happiness depends on you

Espresso, Latte, or drip brew

Caffeine



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down

Though HEAD moves ever faster

We’ll get ‘em into master

Drupal eight six is right on time



Don’t try to be backportin’

Just make sure you’re supportin’

At least through D seven’s lifetime

Switch the branch, diff the base,

Add the file, push the change

Uptime!



Fetch a change, get the diff

‘vert the head, add the patch,

Cut a tag, push it out

Uptime!

The Drupler
===



On a warm summer’s evenin’ on a hyperloop for nowhere

I met up with the Drupler, we were both too wired to sleep

So we took turns a starin’ as the data stream got slower

‘Til boredom overtook us and we began to text



She said son I made a life, out of readin’ people’s coding

And knowing what the bugs were 

by the way they crossed their eyes

So if you don’t mind me saying, I can see your out of RAM,

For a taste of your WiFi, I’ll give you some advice



So I texted her my password and she pulled down my last data

Then she sipped up her water and asked to turn down the light

And the night got deathly quiet and her face lost all expression she said

If you’re gonna code the Drupal, boy you gotta learn to code it right



You got to know how to code em, know how to tag ‘em

Know when Composer works, and just when to Drush

You never ignore the comments, when you’re busy interdiffin’

There’ll be time enough commitin’, when the code is done.



Every Drupler knows that the secret to survivin’

Is knowin’ what to comment out and what to keep

Because every View is a winner and Overlays are losers

And the best that you can hope for is to pass all your tests.



And when she finished speakin’

She turned off the WiFi

Shut down her iPhone and passed out asleep

And somewhere in the darkness, the Drupler, closed her laptop

But in her Pull Request I found the code that I could share



You got to know how to code em, know how to tag ‘em

Know when Composer works, and just when to Drush

You never ignore the comments, when you’re busy interdiffin’

There’ll be time enough commitin’, when the code is done.



You got to know how to code em, know how to tag ‘em

Bike Shedders in the Sky
===



A Drupal dev was working hard one dark and windy day

Upon a bug he stumbled and it got into his way

He looked it up on D dot O, imagine what he saw:

As comments scrolled forever, he recalled Parkinson’s Law



Yippee yi yay

Yippie yi yo

The bike shedders in the sky



The comments came from everywhere, from names he’d never heard

Each with their own opinion, even if it was absurd

And as he reached the bottom, and the pager came in view

His speakers played a distant song, a melody he knew:



Yippee yi yay

Yippie yi yo

The bike shedders in the sky



The tone was tense, the logic tight, each with their own mind set

The header on the issue said “we cannot patch this yet,

For we’ve got to find consensus ‘fore we let this issue by,”

The arguments went round and round, and he heard their mournful cry



Yippie yi yay

Yippie yi oh

Bike shedders in the sky



(Let's hear a yeeeeeeHAW!)



As the comments scrolled on up his screen, he saw one with his name

“If you want to get it fixed in head, escaping all this flame

The community must change today, or with us you will ride

Tryin’ to post the devil’s patch, amid endless outcry



Yippie yi yay

Yippie yi ooh



Bike shedders in the sky

Bike shedders in the sky

Bike shedders in the sky

These Sprints are Made for Codin’
===



You keep saying Drupal 8 is for me

Something you call love but confess

You’ve been Word Pressin where you shouldn’t’ve been Word Pressin,

Now your front end is all one big mess



These sprints are made for coding

And that’s just what we’ll do

One of these days we’ll make a core committer out of you 



You keep pulling when you should be pushing

You keep blaming when you oughta not yet

You keep Gruntin’ when you oughta be a Gulping

Your SaaS is right but it ain’t committed yet



These sprints are made for coding

And that’s just what we’ll do

One of these days we’ll make a core committer out of you  



You keep coding where you shouldn’t be coding

And you keep thinking core is yours to mess (NO)

I just found me a brand new repo to clone (YEAH)

And what they knows you ain’t had time to learn



These sprints are made for coding

And that’s just what we’ll do

One of these days we’ll make a core committer out of you 

Are you ready, committer? Start codin’ ...

D dot O!

If it hadn’t been for D dot O

I’d still be coding a long time ago

Where did you come from where did you go

Here we go with D dot O!

(sing 2x)

(Instrumental break 2x chorus)



She mentored newbies wherever she went

The hordes of maintainers grew at every event

The bugs went away so nobody would know

There was ever bad code on the D dot O
