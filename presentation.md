Friends in low basements
===



Oh the site wouldn’t boot

Couldn’t log in as root

The database tables were bare



The last one to know

Site monitor’s slow

I was the first one

Who should have been there.



I was caught by surprise

And had fear in my eyes

When my boss asked me to explain.



And I turned to you

Said, “Buddy, we may be through.”

But you just smiled and exclaimed ...



Well I got friends in low basements

Where the admins lurk

And a cron takes a backup every day



So we’ll be okay!



Now I’ve been to some nerdy places

But that server room’s a geek oasis

Oh, I’ve got friends in low basements



(cheer for the solo!)



Well something went wrong

The config was gone

But then, we’ve all been there before,



Now nothing looks right

Not even line height

And the front page just links to “Read more...”



Hey I didn’t mean

To cause a big scene

Just give me ten minutes and then



The site will be up

Without even a hiccup

Just as it has been



Well I got friends in low basements

Where the admins lurk

And a cron takes a backup every day



So we’ll be okay!



Now I’ve been to some nerdy places

But that server room’s a geek oasis

Oh, I’ve got friends in low basements



(Oh no, is he really interrupting the song? This is totally unplanned!)



Well something went wrong

The config was gone

But then, we’ve all been there before,



Now nothing looks right

Not even line height

And the front page just links to “Read more...”



Hey I didn’t mean

To cause a big scene

Just wait ‘till I rewrite this class



‘Cuz sooner or later

I’ll be back in the code

And you can kiss my SaaS!



Well I got friends in low basements

Where the admins lurk

And a cron takes a backup every day



So we’ll be okay!



Now I’ve been to some nerdy places

But that server room’s a geek oasis

Oh, I’ve got friends in low basements

Stand by your code
===

Sometimes it’s hard to be a coder

Giving all your nights to open source.



You’ll have bad times

And laggy run times

Seeing things that you just can’t debug



But if you love it, you’ll forgive it,

Even though it’s hard to understand



And if you love it,

Oh be proud of it,

‘Cause after all it’s just some code



*Stand by your code*,

Keep checking on the bug queue

Make sure your README’s clear, too

When nights are cold and lonely



Stand by your code,

And show the world it’s open

Keep giving all the code you can



Stand by your code.



Stand by your code

And show the world you love it

Keep giving all the code you can!

Stand by your code!

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

Please I’ve got a deadline coming ‘round



In cups of tea, you take good care

Of worn out people everywhere

First thing today, I ground my coffee beans



First cup was like a breath of spring

The next was good, it woke my brain

And I cannot work without you

Caffeine



You keep me from the arms of sleep

And there’s nothing I can do to keep

From crying when my cup is done

Caffeine



And work gets really hard to do

My being suffers without you

But you don’t know what you mean to me,

Caffeine



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

Please I’ve got a deadline coming ‘round



I could skip a day or ten

But I could never work again

Without the only drug for me

Caffeine



I have to have some more of you

My happiness depends on you

Espresso, Latte, or drip brew

Caffeine



Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down

Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine, Caffeine

I’m begging of you please don’t let me down



Caffeine, Caffeine
